# Titanic Kaggle Competition - Exploratory Data Analysis and Predictive Modeling

## Overview
This project provides an in-depth analysis of the Titanic dataset from the Kaggle competition. It demonstrates a complete approach to data exploration, feature engineering, and predictive modeling, specifically focusing on the Random Forest algorithm to classify which passengers survived the Titanic disaster.

## Features
- **Data Exploration:** Detailed analysis of passenger demographics, survival rates, and feature correlations to understand the dataset better.
- **Feature Engineering:** Creation of new variables, handling missing data, and encoding categorical features to improve model performance.
- **Random Forest Modeling:** Implementation of the Random Forest algorithm, including feature importance analysis to identify key predictors of survival.
- **Model Evaluation:** Evaluation of the Random Forest model using accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and confusion matrix to measure performance.
- **Error Analysis:** Examination of misclassified cases to identify areas for potential model refinement.
